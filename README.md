# Run security audit
npm run security-audit

# Fix security issues
npm audit fix
```

## Usage

1. Download from [Releases](https://github.com/rogu3bear/n8n/releases)
2. Run the appâ€”create a workflow (e.g., HTTP request to log data)
3. Check logs in ~/.n8n/logs if it bombs

1. **Debug Main Process**
   - F5 or select "Debug Main Process" from the debug menu
   - Debugs the Electron main process
   - Breakpoints in `src/core/main.js`

2. **Debug Renderer Process**
   - Debugs the Electron renderer process
   - Breakpoints in `src/renderer/` files
   - Chrome DevTools integration

3. **Debug Tests**
   - Runs Jest tests with debugging
   - Breakpoints in test files
   - Full test coverage debugging

4. **Debug Test Mode**
   - Runs the app in test mode
   - Tests workflow execution
   - Breakpoints in `src/tests/`

5. **Debug Performance Test**
   - Measures app startup time
   - Performance profiling
   - Memory leak detection

### Terminal Testing
