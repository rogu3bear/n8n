# n8n Desktop Wrapper Application State

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
- `src/core/`: Main application logic and entry points
- `src/services/`: Business logic and external service integrations
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions and shared code
- `src/config/`: Configuration management
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `src/assets/`: Static resources
- `src/styles/`: Styling and theming

## Current Goals
1. Docker Integration
   - Check if Docker is installed
   - Provide installation options (CLI vs Desktop)
   - Guide users through installation process
   - Verify installation success

2. State Management
   - Implement efficient state management
   - Handle application state persistence
   - Manage window state
   - Handle dependency state

3. Performance Optimization
   - Lazy loading of dependencies
   - Efficient resource management
   - Optimized state updates
   - Resource cleanup

## Development Progress
- [x] Initial project setup
- [x] Basic Electron wrapper structure
- [x] Docker installation verification
- [x] Installation guidance interface
- [x] State management implementation
- [x] Resource optimization
- [ ] Docker installation process
- [ ] Post-installation verification
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Resource usage optimization

## Technical Requirements
- Node.js v16+
- npm v10+
- Python 3.x
- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)
- Electron v28+

## User Flow
1. Application Launch
   - Check system requirements
   - Verify Docker installation
   - Initialize state management
   - Load core services
   - If Docker not installed:
     - Present installation options
     - Guide through chosen installation method
     - Verify installation
   - If Docker installed:
     - Proceed with n8n setup

## Best Practices
- Clear user guidance
- Graceful error handling
- Progress tracking
- Installation verification
- User-friendly interface
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Efficient resource management
- State persistence
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations
